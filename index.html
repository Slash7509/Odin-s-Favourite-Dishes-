    <h2>About the Website!</h2>
    <p>Why did I build this website? Well obviously because to progress further in TOP i have to! But also because writing code is just one part of programming. The second and arguably the most <strong>important</strong> part of programming is your <em>creativity</em>. While it is amazing to know some code without a vision you can get nowhere. So take this as a reminder. If you want to learn a skill add that extra bit of <strong>ambition</strong> and <strong>passion</strong> behind it or you will get nowhere. Also Odin has great taste don't you think? <em>Please say yes</em>. In this website we are going to explore our man Odin's favorite tastes. I got these recipes at great personal risk so <em>Please</em> keep them safe in your hands! We are going to rank these foods, from the Very Best to the Best! (All of them are good)</p>
