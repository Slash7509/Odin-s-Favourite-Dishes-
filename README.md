# Odin-s-Favorite-Dishes-
My first ever public html file! It will be cool, Since I owe my skills (however horrible) to TOP I decided why not return the favour by making a list of his favorite food recipes! P.S: This is TOP SECRET so if you find this your lucky!
By the end of this project I will accomplish the following:
-Incorporate all what you have learned from TOP so far into this project
-Make a list of Odin's Favorite Food Recipes!
-Learn something new. I have realized that this section of TOP doesn't utilize the full capabilities of HTML, So learn something while I can !
-At least get 1 like other than me :D.
-Strictly stick to HTML. ALL CHANGES must be done with HTML.
-Make good commits (and commit messages) and get a good idea of how to use git and GitHub.
-Make the Website look more aesthetically pleasing (as much as possible)!
-Have fun :D.
